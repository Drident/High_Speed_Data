@W: MT531 :"c:\users\christop.grobety\bachelor\bachelor\board\concat\bachelor.vhd":976:4:976:5|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 37 sequential elements including I_DUT.U_4.NCs_1[3].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\christop.grobety\bachelor\bachelor\board\concat\bachelor.vhd":1206:2:1206:3|Found inferred clock EC5LP|iGCK_clk which controls 124 sequential elements including I_DUT.U_6.count[4:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
